				<title>The Dummyâ€™s Guide to Coding for Minibus Taxis</title>
				<description>Our company is Sebenza, and we have installed 5000 wifi routers in minibus taxis across South Africa to get internet into the hands of those that can scarce afford it.
Along the way, we had to learn how to code for the minibus - that is, being able to work on the cheapest of phones, sometimes with limited signal, all running through complex custom firmware that run on routers.
In short - we made so many early mistakes from our choice of stack, to our rollout approach and implementation, that this talk is an ode to what we figured out along the way, what technologies worked, and how we bent them to our will.
This is, in fact, a coder's starter kit to building for the uniquely South African experience and its limitations and strengths.
We won't spend too much time on the wide spectrum of material here, but rather framing this as a journey against sometimes-hostile tech and our own desperate attempts not to succumb to the growing dread that we were, in fact, Dunning Kruger sufferers.</description>

				<title>Dysfunctional Requirements Obviously!  Being Deliberate about Quality Attributes</title>
				<description>I am so tired of "Obviously".  It's too late for "Obviously".  I never want to hear "Obviously" again.
In a world where non-functional requirements are left to chance, a lone developer bravely confronts software quality.  She sighs deeply.
Obviously our app needs four nines reliabilty.  Obviously it must respond within 200 ms.  Obviously a toddler should find it easy to use.  Obviously it should scale to 100 000 users.  Obviously it must repel attacks from Anonymous. There's nothing obvious about any of this!
We think we can fulfil these requirements at no cost, but we can't.  We think they'll just emerge, and we're disappointed. We never define quality attributes well enough.  Not across the board. If we're deliberate about performance and security, we neglect modifiability and availability.  Why do we do this?  Again and again...
Is it too late?  Or can one intrepid developer lead us to a safer place?  One iteration at a time.  Never to be bullied with "Obviously" again...</description>

				<title>The science of queues: Performance monitoring theme parks (and distributed systems)</title>
				<description>Performance monitoring is an important part of running a successful theme park. Like a distributed system, theme parks have separate components (attractions). Each has a queue in front of it. How can we find out which of them are the least efficient? Which ones are slowing us down? Where should we spend time optimizing?
Join me for a roller-coaster ride through distributed system performance monitoring. Find out which measurements tell you the most about your system and how to optimize it. As an added bonus, you'll learn how to run a successful theme park!</description>

				<title>A World Without Passwords? Are We There Yet?</title>
				<description>Passwords are the bane of my existence, and I'm sure they're yours too. We're constantly burdened with creating complex passwords, forgetting them, resetting them, and eventually settling for something simple (and weak), leaving us vulnerable to account takeover attacks from credential spraying and phishing.
As developers, we have the power to rid the world of passwords and provide better authentication experiences for our users. Passwordless forms of authentication exist, but they're flying under the radar due to a lack of awareness and education. It's time to shine a light on them.
In this talk, you'll learn about the existing forms of passwordless authentication (webAuthn + passkeys), and leave with knowledge of how you can start adopting them into your products.</description>

				<title>Building Yourself an AI Powered Microscope</title>
				<description>Are you fascinated by the prospect of assembling your own intelligent Digital Microscope, writing the control software for it and deploying it from the cloud?  If the answer is yes, then this session is for you!
The other title for this talk could have been "How I solved my own accessibility problems with tech and AI".   What started as a mobile app project to read the part numbers on integrated circuits has transformed to become a Raspberry Pi Linux based kiosk app, Digital Microscope powered by AI Vision.  The reason for this: it's becoming increasingly hard for me to read the text on IC's (without a magnifying glass).  The ONLY solution to this accessibility issue is ofcourse with technology and electronics!!!
Imagine building your own Microscope that can read text, identify objects, and gain insights from the visuals.   We could call this "Copilot for Microscopes"!
Join me for a fun "Do-it-yourself" session with demos and code!</description>

				<title>Embracing Neurodiversity in the Software Industry</title>
				<description>Neurodiversity refers to the range of differences in how individuals cognitively process the world around them. Neurodiversity is an umbrella term that includes (but is not limited to) autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and Tourette's disorder. Individuals with these differences make up a large portion of the population and it is found that the software industry seems to be an attractive industry for individuals with these differences, therefore it is imperative to embrace this population to better understand their differences, the strengths that they bring to the table, and the common difficulties that they may face in a workplace setting.</description>

				<title>From Overheating to Overachieving: A Comedic Tale of Hacking My Car</title>
				<description>Embark on a humorous and enlightening journey into the world of car hacking in this developer-focused conference talk. As my trusty old car overheated and befuddled multiple repair shops, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Armed with an OBD connector, I ventured to uncover the secrets hidden within my vehicle's systems.
In this presentation, I'll guide you through the process of reverse engineering, offering a brief Electronics 101 for beginners. Discover how I used Arduino to decode the mysterious signals on the car's CAN bus. Along the way, I'll share my humorous misadventures and the lessons learned from my escapades.
But the journey doesn't stop there. I'll also explore the exciting possibilities that car hacking opens up. Learn how a friend transformed his gasoline car into an electric marvel using the same techniques.</description>

				<description>WebAssembly. Wasm. Wat. What? What?!
It's everywhere, in the browser, on the server, embedded devices, your preferred runtime. Every. Where.  Why should you start to take note? How can Wasm be a cohesive force, allowing you to use the best tools for the job, yet still remain portable and performant.
Rust, Zig, Go, Python and friends can all work together using WebAssembly. We've heard it before, but what does it mean in practice? What does this unlock, for you, the developer?
Let's see how Wasm can make you more productive, open up new possibilities and allow contributions from many different disciplines to come together and form the solutions we need for modern challenges.
I will share lessons learned in bringing together various development efforts to build a solution that would be a serious challenge to do with only one or two programming languages or frameworks.</description>

				<title>I Can't Believe It's Not Native!</title>
				<description>The web's come a long way, baby!
The gap between the web and native platforms has been closing for years, and it's finally gotten really small.
It used to be that web applications did not have access to a lot of mobile platform functionality, but did you know that you can access Bluetooth, NFC, USB directly from a web app, and that iOS Safari finally supports web push notifications?
Even with the new platform capabilities of the modern web, you may still be concerned about performance! Aren't web browsers slow? I'll cover how you can build UIs that look and feel just as slick as a native UI.
Of course, there are no silver bullets, so I'll also discuss when the web is not a good choice, and you might prefer to go native.</description>
