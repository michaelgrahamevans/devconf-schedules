				<title>Create the sustainable home farm of your dreams!</title>
				<description>Are you interested in growing your own food at home, but unsure of how to get started? Do you want to create a sustainable home farm that is both productive and environmentally friendly? Look no further!
In this exciting presentation, we will be exploring the amazing potential of using your dev skills in C# and  .NET, using .NET Nanoframework on microcontrollers (ESP32) and the cloud to create a sustainable home farm. By leveraging the power of these technologies, you can optimize your home farm for maximum productivity, sustainability and power efficiency.    But best of all not have it be a full time job to maintain as a home farmer.
Join me on my journey of builidng my own farm at home and I will cover my experiences and everything needed to build a ruggedized, weather-proof, outdoor farming system: powered by the sun and irrigated by rainwater.</description>

				<title>Microservice Reuse: Some Unintended Consequences</title>
				<description>The conventional microservice wisdom is to package business logic in a service and reuse it.  But integration is hard.  This talk is about the times I've under-estimated just how hard.
We work through a case study based on some real projects I've been involved in.  We look at how a team reuses a microservice, and how this has some unintended consequences. And we look at how these are addressed and overcome.
We review the team's experience from a number of angles, drawing on ideas from Domain Driven Design, integration patterns, scaling agile teams, and good old Conway's Law.  While celebrating the team's success, we consider carefully what hindsight is teaching us.
We may learn a few things about microservices and when to reuse them.  We may even see microservices from a slightly different point of view.  But at the very least, we'll have a few more questions to ask before we decide to reuse another microservice.</description>

				<title>Zen and the Art of Software Maintenance</title>
				<description>Software either dies, or it needs to be maintained.
The art of software maintenance is a balancing act between constraints on the project that are in dynamic tension with one another. Satisfying one of these often means trading off against another. Or does it?
What is Quality in Software? According to whom? Is it purely subjective? Or are there ways to measure it?  More broadly than that, does it even matter?
Even if I claim to know what Quality is, can I claim to know what causes Quality?
In the last decade, studies on Software Engineering have emerged that are scientifically rigorous and whose findings are giving us meaningful insight into what drives good software engineering. No longer do we have to settle for picking a side between different ideologies based chiefly on their champions' force of personality.
Find out why we should care about the Quality of our code beyond romantic notions like elegance. Even your boss will like what I have to say.</description>

				<title>Satellites are the future, are your space development skills up to date? [PRE-RECORDED]</title>
				<description>These days rockets and satellites are being launched almost every week. More and more software developers will get exciting opportunities to write code for satellites (tracking, communication or even code running on satellites). Before you miss that opportunity, why not start playing with satellites, let's chat about tracking satellites, communicating with them (receive and transmit) with your own ground station and also talk about the various frameworks available to develop your own tracking software, communication software and even make your own physical satellite simulator. Space is the future, are you prepared?
Note: Tom cannot join us due to a last-minute issue but has pre-recorded his session, which will be shown in the timeslot.</description>

				<title>A Developers odyssey to overcoming fear, anxiety, and burnout.</title>
				<description>As professionals in the IT industry, we sometimes have trouble we wish wasn't there and it’s hard for us to understand, internalize, and process non-technical challenges. We are immersed in an ever-changing, fast-moving, and demanding world that expects nothing but the best from us while constantly throwing challenges at us. We feel uncertain, unfulfilled, exhausted, stressed, and we wonder how we've lost our energy, excitement, and enthusiasm.
In this session, I will use valuable lessons from my dev career spanning two decades, combined with years of research in mental health and cognitive behavior analysis to share principles that helped me through a remarkable recovery from stress, anxiety, burnout, depression, and ulcers.
Enjoying a fulfilling IT career requires more than just technical skills. It requires all of you. Let this session help you become more resilient and better equipped to overcome obstacles and live abundantly.</description>

				<title>So how does having fun make you a better developer? Does it really? Can it?</title>
				<description>Somewhere along the line, we tend to forget why we fell in love with programming. It goes from being fun to just a job. And jobs suck. Yes, your job sucks, I said it and you know it!
But what can we do? How can we get the fun factor back, but still pretend to be responsible adults?
What if I told you having fun IS the responsible thing to do? What if I can show you how writing your own silly games and simulations can help you learn new languages, techniques, improve your algorithms and resource usage?
Come with me on a journey of discovery. One where I tell you how I lost all the fun in my career and what I did to get it back. Along the way, we'll use a decidedly back-end language, Go, to do fun stuff. Stuff Go isn't known for and probably shouldn't be used for either.
Of course, this IS a sneaky talk about showing you Go, how you can use it outside the usual API, NFT or Crypto spaces and still have fun doing it! Plus Go sucks, but not as much your preferred language!</description>

				<title>Building a vaccine register on the Ethereum blockchain</title>
				<description>Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that allows exchange of value and data between network participants. By having this ledger as a single source of truth, trust is built and time-wasting reconciliations of data are minimised. In this talk, I give a primer on blockchain technology with a focus on the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem of tools, followed by a demo of a blockchain-based web application for tracking vaccine recipients (e.g. COVID-19). The demo illustrates the use of Ethereum blockchain to provide a single source of truth for vaccination records and how the different technology pieces fit together - the web application, the solidity smart contract and a local instance of an Ethereum blockchain network.</description>

				<title>Mental Illness and Vulnerability in Tech</title>
				<description>In his seminal “Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression”, Andrew Solomon remarked that there is an entire world of silent “agonizing lives in invisible wheelchairs, dressed in invisible bodycasts". It is becoming increasingly apparent that the tech sector is no exception. In the recent “Mental Health in Tech Survey" only 30.7% of respondents indicated that they “feel comfortable discussing mental health with coworkers”. This seems unsurprising, given that when mental health was discussed only 33.6% of respondents “experienced or observed a supportive or well-handled response”. As someone with a history of mental illness myself, I spent the last year conducting interviews with individuals struggling with mental health in the tech sector. In addition, I also interviewed legal and therapeutic practitioners to create a list of avenues of support you are legally entitled to as a South African citizen. In this talk, I hope to share some insights uncovered during this personal investigation.</description>

				<title>Assessing the performance of your engineering team</title>
				<description>Assessing the performance of a software engineering team has for a long time been viewed as a complex or even controversial undertaking. However without having some form of performance measurements in place, many engineering teams are operating in the dark. There is a famous quote about this - “You can't improve what you don't measure.”
There is no one solution to engineering measurement, rather there are many modes of engineering measurement, each of which is appropriate for a given scenario.
In this talk I will share what you should measure in order to have good insight into the performance of your engineering team. After you apply the suggested approaches you will be clear on the state of your team for each of the following:
1 - The value the product built by your team is providing for users
2 - The technical quality of the solutions built by your team
3 - The efficiency of your team's processes
4 - The health / culture of your team</description>

				<title>Growing Software Engineering Leadership Competencies</title>
				<description>The demand for software engineering capability outweighs the supply in the industry with the shortage of software engineering skills being a significant contributor. Software engineering managers can play a crucial role in growing software engineering skills. However, there is no defined way to train software engineering managers and equip them with the required competencies. My recent master's thesis explored this in depth with software engineering leaders in industry using a phenomenological study. In this talk I will discuss my findings and propose some solutions with the aim of gathering further feedback from the community to improve the state of software engineering skills in industry.</description>

				<title>How we cut 20M daily API calls and saved $30k a month on our infrastructure.</title>
				<description> I’ll dive into how we halved the network traffic from our users by analysing the lifecycle of React-Native in its handling of background tasks.
Outline:
- Use-case of Apple’s Healthkit and step-counts functionality for Relive
- Interface with Healthkit via a library that we’ve written ourselves
- We saw incredible amounts of API calls being made while the app is in the background and the user is not even using the app
- Apple Healthkit notifies us of new activities, and step-counts, which triggers the app to launch, in turn instantiating the bridge and RCTRootView
- The root of the app is mounted while the app is in the background busy processing this notification
- Native solution is not possible, since the handlers are in the JS layer
- To solve this, introduce a wrapper that is aware of the app state before mounting the app
- Share learnings about the importance of understanding the RN lifecycle
- Share learnings about the importance of investigating smelly events in your analytics</description>

				<description>Taking the cheapest smart watch on Takealot, completely reverse engineering it and building new software for it adding the features I want.
Find out how to dump firmware, identify components, decode buses and make things blink while destroying only a few watches.
This talk is filled with hardware hacking, reverse engineering, a little embedded software and a lot of googling and at the end of it all I might still have a watch that tells the time with working bluetooth.</description>

				<title>Automated Canary Tests with Internal Users</title>
				<description>In 1911-1986 miners used canaries in coal mines to detect carbon monoxide and other toxic gases before they hurt humans. Today we use this process as an analogy to describe canary tests that use real internal users to pick up issues before deploying the change to real customers.
- At the end of my talk, the audience will get to learn:
    - How automated canary tests limit the risk of disruption for the entire user base.
    - Running canary tests with feature flags
    - Benefits of canary tests in reducing production bugs
    - A demo on how we run Canary test at Paystack</description>

				<title>Chasing Rainbows: The Shifting Challenges of Scaling Up.</title>
				<description>While growing our startup from initial success with a team of 6 to a headcount approaching 100 we faced many hurdles that come with scaling up an engineering team. We're dealing with technical, team structure, and knowledge sharing challenges. All of these require tradeoffs as we're building out the system, while running it 24/7.
I will cover some of the specific challenges faced when things don't scale well, how we moved past them, and lessons learned.
The problems we faced ranged from technical, like how early choices in a growing code base painted us into a corner later, to how a growing user base coupled with growing system complexity lead to difficult tradeoffs for deployments, and making sure a growing team speeds up, rather than slowing down.
Crucially, you can't scale up the last man who knew everything (me), and expect the engineering team and output to scale up while he is in the centre of it all and not sharing knowledge.</description>

				<title>How to build a pair of SASL gloves</title>
				<description>I once built a pair of South African Sign Language gloves which convert sign language into spoken English. I used a total of 22 sensors and developed a pair of gloves which can translate dynamic and static gestures with an accuracy of 98.7%. There were many things I learnt whilst doing this including: assistive technologies need to be informed by the people they're meant to assist and that you should never get your mom to sew the gloves as it will create tension in your family.
In this session, we will go through how to build the gloves and what I learnt whilst doing it.</description>

				<title>The State of the South African Software Developer Nation in 2023</title>
				<description>Our 2023 State of the Dev Nation report aggregates the experience of over 4,500 South African devs. Some key insights: The South African tech industry avoided mass-scale layoffs, with only 3% reporting being laid off in 2022. The rising inflation means companies will be stricter with hiring and developers may need to make some trade-offs during their job search. We’ll cover what that means for the 30% of developers looking to change roles this year.</description>

				<title>Making secure development practices fun in web engineering</title>
				<description>As software development becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, ensuring the security of applications is more important than ever. However, it can be difficult to get developers to prioritize security, especially when it is seen as a burden or an afterthought. This talk aims to change that perception by demonstrating how security can be made into a fun and engaging part of the development process.
Through interactive exercises and real-world examples, attendees will learn how to create a culture of security within their organization and how to make security practices an integral part of their development workflow. Attendees will also learn how to use tools and resources to make security testing and code reviews more efficient and effective.
By the end of this talk, attendees will have a new appreciation for the role of security in development and will have a set of practical strategies for making secure development practices a more enjoyable and integral part of their work.</description>

				<title>End Procrastination Tomorrow! Doing things later can make your system better</title>
				<description>Are you looking to improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of your system while doing less work right now? Many people believe that doing things right away is the best approach, but what if putting some things off until later is a good thing?
In this session, we will explore the benefits of designing your system to embrace procrastination. We'll look at techniques like delayed delivery, and long-running business process patterns such as the Saga and Process Manager patterns. We will discuss the types of delays that can occur in a system, how the Saga and Process Manager patterns can handle failures and complex workflows, and review real-world examples. Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of when and how to implement these patterns for simpler systems architecture.</description>

				<title>Achieving Inclusivity Through Remote Work</title>
				<description>A strength of the tech industry is its ability to facilitate remote work. Remote work helps people — particularly people who are part of marginalized communities, such as folks who are undergoing a gender transition. We often talk about how to foster inclusive teams and remote work can be a big factor in that!
In this talk, you’ll learn about barriers that disproportionately affect underrepresented folks in tech, like health concerns, financial/geographical logistics and emotional burnout, as well as the ways working remotely can ease those burdens, and how to promote healthy distributed teams.</description>

				<title>Six Small Steps towards Continuous Delivery</title>
				<description>It's 12 years since the eponymous Continuous Delivery book (Farley/Humble) was published.
Many conference talks and articles assume that CD is a done deal. But the State of DevOps Report 2022 shows that 90% of respondents have deployment frequencies and lead times of between 1 week and 6 months (compared to the 10% of 'high performers' who can release on-demand - the very definition of Continuous Delivery).
This talk aims to avoid just describing what the destination looks like, but instead focuses on six, tangible, independent actions that delivery teams can take, to move towards - or to improve - their continuous delivery ambitions.</description>

				<description>A story about how and why we drank the SPA kool-aid, realized there are considerable drawbacks to this, and now are gradually changing to new meta-frameworks that bring back the best of classical MPAs.
This talk is about the weaknesses of SPAs and the benefits of server-side rendering. Furthermore, we look at the long-forgotten art of progressive enhancement.
Finally, we'll compare popular meta frameworks for React, Vue, and Svelte and their ups and downs. And we want to investigate how they can help us build better, more resilient applications faster.</description>

				<title>From Zero to Hero; Growing a Software Development Apprenticeship Program From Concept to Success!</title>
				<description>As a young company based on the East Coast of South Africa, we always battled to find great developers!
7 years ago we made the decision to change our approach and instead of trying to find great people, we decided to help develop them instead. Leveraging our internal company ethos of learning, as well as our tag line "Learn, Grow, Deliver" we embarked on a journey to grow young developers and positively contribute to the software development ecosystem.
This is not only the story of our journey, it is also the story of some of our juniors who have been through the apprenticeship program and are now leaders in our and other organisations.
In this talk we cover:
* The inception of the Apprenticeship program.
* Our approach to growing young software developers.
* How we fast tracking growing young leaders and encourage them to stay with us.</description>

				<title>A11y beyond the theory: Integrating accessibility testing into your workflow</title>
				<description>Ensuring that we build accessible solutions is about more than the moral obligation of removing accessibility barriers for all. It has significant financial and commercial implications too. With more than 30% of the population living with some form of impairment, the industry is finally coming to terms with the importance of accessibility.
However, while the theory appears to be understood, accessibility considerations in software solutions are still treated as a nice-to-have and an afterthought. One of the big reasons for this is that testing for accessibility requires extra work.
In this hands-on talk, we'll go through a brief outline of what A11y is and its importance. We'll then dive into key practical tools that can be used by everyone in the software development lifecycle to ensure that the solutions we produce are as accessible as possible.
If you're interested in making sure you provide accessible software solutions for everyone, then this talk is for you.</description>

				<title>How Kubernetes made our staging environment disappear</title>
				<description>Kubernetes is an extremely powerful tool that takes IaC to the next level.
In this talk, I'll walk through how we built a set of automated pipelines that allowed us to spin up on-demand review environments for each piece of work-in-progress that live safely alongside our production code. This has eliminated the need for clunky shared staging environments.
I'll talk about the pitfalls of putting all your infrastructure eggs in one kubernetes basket, but also give you tips and tricks on how to maximise reuse in your cluster.
Our K8S journey has been long, expensive, illuminating, and ultimately rewarding, and we'd love to share how introducing it into our environment has revolutionised the way ship value.</description>

				<title>Demystifying Data Science</title>
				<description>Today’s world generates different kinds of data at unbelievably rapid rates. One often hears that Data Science is changing the world - but what does it mean? Why use it? What questions can it answer?
This talk introduces Data Science and explains the Data Science pipeline and algorithms using real-life examples. It also gives an overview of the common frameworks used for the various processes involved. It is aimed at budding data scientists and anyone curious about interpreting data.
By the end of this session, audience members will have a better grasp of the capabilities and processes of Data Science. They will be familiar with the general structure of a Data Science pipeline, the frameworks commonly used and will develop a strong foundation to continue learning and experimenting in Data Science.</description>

				<title>The Line of Code That Crashed a Rocket</title>
				<description>On June 4 1996, Ariane 5 flight 501 launched from a spaceport in French Guiana, loaded with expensive satellites full of scientific equipment. Just 37 seconds into the flight, it exploded.
What caused the eight billion dollar failure was a simple software bug. One wrong line of code. One developer's mistake.
Or... was it really?
Can a catastrophic failure in such an extremely complex system be caused by one single person's oversight?
Let's take a look at the offical ESA Inquiry Board report - in the style of Air Crash Investigations. We'll dig deeper into the many hidden causes of the crash of Ariane 5's maiden flight and analyse them from the point of view of a software quality engineer. We will see that there are many lessons to be learned about quality culture that are applicable to our own everyday work.</description>

				<title>The Clashes of the Titans - Usability vs. Security. Can They Live Together?</title>
				<description>Security is a critical component in every app. A single mistake or breach can destroy a business. However, security can also be a nuisance and complicate your UX flows. This talk will discuss one of the most common security precautions - password strength. We will dive into the importance of your customers’ passwords, learn how to evaluate them and have a look at some of the tools that can help you do that efficiently. In addition, we will cover some of the tradeoffs between product &amp; security and how the use of a smart algorithm can simplify your UX without compromising security.</description>

				<title>You'll never get rid of Legacy code: Why &amp; what we can do about it</title>
				<description>The talk tackles the problem all companies face - re-wiriting legacy code bases. When a business is started, decisions are made that aren't well thought out, or that "will be fixed later" (how many times have we heard that). Years later when we realise the time has come to re-write a code base being held together by duct tape and glue (some large corporates have scary code bases), we will always encounter 1 major hurdle - we cannot get rid of the legacy monolith entirely. The talk will cover what technical debt you will most likely be stuck with (things like dbs, process flows, upgrade limitations, etc), and then how you can get around this problem of still needing your legacy system in some shape or form, but re-writing it at the same time. Having worked for 2 fintech companies that needed to be pulled apart into micro-services, I've seen these issues first hand, and that inspired me to put together a talk about it's challenges.</description>

				<title>The contractor I want to hire, the contractor I want to be</title>
				<description>Contractors are often the most expensive people on the team (especially in SA), but success varies dramatically.
A good contractor delivers, ask the right questions, collaborates well, explains trade-offs, and demonstrates ownership. They do all that while making the code better and inspiring the client team to do the same.
A bad contractor doesn't deliver, expects to be told what to do, hides from help, and complains when questioned. They do all that while making the code worse and discouraging teammates.
Success varies over time, too: an ex-CTO with a successful startup exit becomes a contractor who won't take initiative; a contractor is fired by one client, but rescues the project at another.
Contractors live in a context. Experience and circumstances play a vital role. Agencies can enhance their strengths or their weaknesses. Clients can provide enabling or disabling environments.
I've been on both sides of the transaction, for better and worse. Come hear what I've learned!</description>
